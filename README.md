go-mailkit
=================================

Silly idea to make postfix, postfixadmin, roundcube, and vacations ..

All adminable via ajax and in this case, PyQt and Ionic clients..


But.. is being actively developed for use on a dedicated mailserver machine..

The Coporate App is a PyQt desktop and mobile interface, so this app can be called from the LAN mainly

The enviroment uses depart/mental shared mailboxes and a multi tasking env, so the system is quite "open to staff on Lan"

The app is designed to run on mailserver, and using

- postfix
- dovecot
- postfixadmin

The goal of this app in part of ongoing dev to convert php/python code to go..
Lets go.. ? where they said... ?? down the pup I said.. ?? why ? cos its easyyii..

DO this is hectic and a mashup of rouncube, postfixadmin et all in ajax feed..
